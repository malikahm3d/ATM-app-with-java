# Bank-app-with-java
This is a ATM application built with java with some online banking functionalities.

This application was part of the course 'Advanced programming'.
We were instructed to build it within 10 days, part of the challenge of the project was time constraints.

The stack for this application:
Java,
Java scene builder,
css,
SQLite.

we worked this project using the Pair programming technique.
I handled the database design and implementation, the design of the views and UI, and contributed to the controller logic and code.
My teammate lead the project, implmented the views and UI, and built the backend.
